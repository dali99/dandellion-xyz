# About me
Hey I'm Dan! I like computers and all things computing! I'm a certified Computer electronics technician,
and I am currently a first-year student taking computer engineering at NTNU in Trondheim.

## Early life

I have been interested in computers for as long as I can honestly remember, and have been using linux based distributions as my personal choice for operating systems since the 7th grade.  
I took an edx course in introduction to computer science (CS50) in secondary school, where I was introduced to C as my first "real" text based programming language
(Thus far I had worked mostly in LabView-like languages like robolab, and scratch, with small amounts of bash).

I was in a club programming LEGO mindstorms and competing in FIRST LEGO LEAGUE since I was 11 to I was too old to compete and transissioned into an instructor role.   
This experience proved useful when I later taught children how to program during my local makerspace's summer school, and later as an outside instructor at an elementary school  

## Videregående

Of course I was also active in this aforementioned makerspace [Horten Folkeverksted](https://folkeverkstedet.com/) where I had the role of infrastructure-responsible and sat on the board of directors.  
I held presentations during our yearly event "Sommer:hack". Holding talks about Matrix, Nix, and also being responsible for hosting the CTF competition, and an introduction to "ethical hacking".  


I took Elektro during Videregående and went into computers and electronics where I learned a lot about electronic components and also programming microcontrollers.
I'm hoping to post about the big project we did that year at some point, but cutting it short, we made a big rubix-cube out of RGB LEDs, 3D-printing, and steel.  
In my third year I was the leader for our student company, which did electronics repair (but mostly helped pentioners with their computers). I was also on the board of the student council.

## University

After I moved to Trondheim I joined Drift at [Programvareverkstedet](https://www.pvv.ntnu.no/), where we maintain an extremely legacy infrastructure (Our DNS-server is a MicroVAX II from 1985) - But also have a lot of fun!  
I've held a course in NixOS and managed to convert a fair few to using nix for their projects.

I'm also part of [hackerspace-ntnu](https://www.hackerspace-ntnu.no/), which is a studentdriven organisation from my institute that has a workshop, 
but also does projects like the making a handheld game console (which I'm part of), or making a full circuitboard sized version of the MOS 6502!

Of course I'm also a member of [Omega Verksted](https://www.omegav.ntnu.no/), but I don't hang around there nearly as much as I should!

I live with a lot of people (>100!), and have a role as part of the IT-gang where I am mostly working with networking infrastructure.

I see myself as someone who has fairly deep knowledge about a very broad set of topics in computing. Especially on the linux front and general programming.  
What I lack in formal education I like to think I have in experience! I've dipped my toe in so many things that it's hard to mention everything!

# Hobbies

In my spare time I maintain my own infrastructure which has gone through many a variation but has settled on a NixOS based config.
Through this homelab I maintain and host most of the services I use day to day.

I of course also program in my spare time, making software that scratches whatever itch I may have.
In the most recent couple of years I have worked mostly on infrastructure as code via NixOS (writing modules), and making and maintaing packages.
But I've also done some small things like writing a distributed video encoding service for encoding AV1, and a couple of matrix bots, not to mention the WIP azul board game AI.

My favorite programming language is Rust, but I really want to learn Haskell as well.

Of course I play video games as well, though mostly Minecraft and Dota 2!  
I enjoy listening to music, watching movies and Anime, and playing boardgames.

Bonus point if you know what my avatar refers to!
